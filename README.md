- 👋 Hi, I’m @jobmulder98
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning and machine perception projects

- On my page you'll find some projects that I've done during some courses of the master Robotics at the TU Delft. The projects are at student level, so please don't expect professional documentation. These were my solutions for the problem so they aren't optimal neither.
